Parents, teachers, and family members of Sanchez Elementary students can be members of the Sanchez Elementary PTA.

Membership cost: $5 per year.

## How to join the PTA

There are two ways to join:

* **Online**: We use [Totem to sign up PTA members online](https://jointotem.com/ca/san-francisco/sanchez-elementary-pta). Consider adding a donation to your membership to support our worthwhile PTA programs.
* **At School**: If youâ€™d prefer to pay with cash or a check, stop by the office. A physical drop box is available for families who would like to join or make a donation.

## Membership benefits

* Members can vote at all Sanchez Elementary PTA General Assembly meetings, where we approve or reject proposals for how to spend PTA funds.  As a member, you help decide how the PTA spends money to benefit students, teachers, and families.
* Discounts and other benefits through the [California PTA](https://capta.org/join/member-perks/) and the [national PTA](https://www.pta.org/home/About-National-Parent-Teacher-Association/Benefits-of-PTA-Membership).
* Your membership helps support the work of the California PTA and the national PTA.  These organizations advocate for our children at the state and national levels.
